=======
ABOUT

BrainTrain is a simple 'brain entrainment' standalone application. Brainwave entrainment is a method to stimulate the brain into entering a specific state by using a pulsing sound, light, or electromagnetic field. The pulses elicit the brain’s ‘frequency following’ response, encouraging the brainwaves to align to the frequency of a given beat.
No Brainer uses binaural beating, with a slight inclusion of white noise to block external sound. Settings for the following wave patterns are included:

* Delta 
* Theta 
* Alpha 
* Mu  
* SMR  
* Beta 
* Gamma 
* Gamma


USE
Download the repo, & execute the No Brainer application.

1. Click on the speaker icon to turn on sound
2. Adjust settings via the big dial by clicking & dragging upwards. Alternatively, you can select settings by clicking on the boxes next to the wave info at the lower left.

That's it! Enjoy some clarity & relaxation.
